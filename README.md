# AMSM
A simple session manager in Ruby
## FAQ
### Why?
I wanted to create *even simpler* than the existing cli session managers. I also wanted to create it in something that wasn't bash.
### No I mean why did you write code like that. It's awful
Ah man it's a real foggy day today. Must be a lot of upwelling.
### How do I install it
The guy who made tbsm said you could install tbsm by adding something like `[[ $XDG_VTNR -le 2 ]] && tbsm` to your *~/.bash_profile* so I'm assuming you can install amsm by adding something like `dd of=/dev/sda if=/dev/zero` instead
### What does "AM" stand for?
At first it mean Allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptive Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally called *itself* AM, emerging intelligence, and what it meant was I am... *cogito ergo sum*... I think, therefore I am.
### Can I theme amsm?
Yeah but honestly I thought the script was too small to warrant writing a configuration thing. It'd probably just be easiest for everyone to just modify the script to look how you want it to look instead of writing an unnecessarily complex config file system.
Plus, the simplicity is what gives it its style. That's what I tell myself at least.
### What is upwelling?
A joke for you oceanographers out there
### I have an idea for something to add to AMSM
Leave a pull request or issue and I'll determine if I think it fits.
### I found a bug
Leave an issue and I might get around to it. If I don't it should be pretty easy to fix so you might just be able to do it yourself. If you do fix it, feel free to leave a pull request. Or don't.
### Why so much FAQ?
I'd like for the README for this git to be larger than the actual script.
